# Making an Instagram Filter is as easy as playing a sport

What is the first thing you do to learn or play a sport? Reach its playground.

## Reaching the Playground

Once done, install the application on your system

Now the application is like your playground or stadium to start playing(making filters)


Before starting to learn any sport, the first thing is to analyze the ground, how many features ,etc does the ground have?

## Knowing your Playground

As soon as you open SparkAR Studio, this will be the entrance of your playground:

At the Entrance, you can either start fresh with New Project, or can choose from any of the templates. Templates are just widely used pre-sets on which you can make chages to make your own filter.

As we are new to this sport, click on *New Project* and then *Blank Project*

Vola! You are now inside the playground!
